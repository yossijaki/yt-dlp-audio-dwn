## üìù How to Use

1. Open `downloads-list.txt` with **Notepad** or any text editor.  
2. Add YT links, **one per line**, for example (put the complete YT word in the real links):

	[https://www.yt.com/watch?v=abc123](https://www.yt.com/watch?v=abc123)  
	[https://www.yt.com/watch?v=def456](https://www.yt.com/watch?v=def456)  
	[https://www.yt.com/watch?v=ghi789](https://www.yt.com/watch?v=ghi789)  


> ‚ö†Ô∏è Each link must be on a separate line. Do not add commas or trailing spaces.

3. Save the file and close the editor.  

4. **Double-click** `downloads.bat`.  
   - The script will dwnld:
     - The audio in **MP3** with best available quality.
     - The video thumbnail cropped as a square.
     - Embed the thumbnail into the MP3 file.
     - Save the final file in the `downloads/` folder using the **YT video title** as the filename.

5. Temporary files will be automatically deleted from `temp-files/` after each dwnld.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- Avoid videos with **age or regional restrictions**, as they may fail to dwnld.
- Do not move or rename `yt-dlp.exe` or `ffmpeg.exe`; they must stay in the `res/` folder.
- If a dwnld fails, check your **internet connection** and that the link is valid (click in the "Share" button below the video to copy the link without any additional playlist added).
