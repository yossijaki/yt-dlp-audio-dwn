## üìù How to Use

1. Open `downloads-list.txt` with **Notepad** or any text editor.  
2. Add YouTube links, **one per line**, for example:

```

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abc123](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abc123)
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=def456](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=def456)
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghi789](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ghi789)

```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Each link must be on a separate line. Do not add commas or trailing spaces.

3. Save the file and close the editor.  

4. **Double-click** `downloads.bat`.  
   - The script will download:
     - The audio in **MP3** with best available quality.
     - The video thumbnail cropped as a square.
     - Embed the thumbnail into the MP3 file.
     - Save the final file in the `downloads/` folder using the **YouTube video title** as the filename.

5. Temporary files will be automatically deleted from `temp-files/` after each download.
